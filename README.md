# Project5
The Parking Space Optimization (PSO) system is designed to maximize parking space utilization through a distance-based vehicle placement strategy. By employing advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, PSO accurately measures the dimensions of incoming vehicles in real-time and calculates the optimal parking spot based on the distances between parked cars. This approach aims to minimize wasted space, reduce congestion, and enhance overall parking efficiency, contributing significantly to urban infrastructure optimization.Read Approach.docx to understand how the project has been approached and completed.
